## Governance Overview

### Current Phase: Foundation

TeachLink is currently in its foundation phase with a maintainer-led governance model. As the project matures, we will transition to a more decentralized DAO governance structure.

### Key Principles

1. **Transparency** - All decisions are publicly documented
2. **Inclusivity** - Everyone can participate
3. **Meritocracy** - Influence earned through contributions
4. **Decentralization** - Moving toward community governance
5. **Accountability** - Decision-makers are accountable
