# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the TeachLink community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Being respectful**: Using welcoming and inclusive language
- **Being empathetic**: Understanding different perspectives and experiences
- **Being constructive**: Providing helpful and actionable feedback
- **Being collaborative**: Working together towards common goals
- **Being accountable**: Accepting responsibility for our mistakes and learning from them
- **Being gracious**: Showing appreciation for contributions from others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (doxxing) without explicit permission
- Spamming, including irrelevant self-promotion
- Dismissive or demeaning comments about someone's contributions
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions, code review)
- Discord server
- Twitter/X interactions related to the project
- Community events and meetups
- Any other official TeachLink communication channels

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by:

1. **Email**: conduct@teachlink.io
2. **GitHub**: Open a private discussion with maintainers
3. **Discord**: Contact a moderator privately

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Report Guidelines

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (usernames) of any individuals involved
- Description of the incident
- Any relevant links, screenshots, or documentation
- Any additional context

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining consequences:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

Anyone who receives a warning or ban may appeal by emailing appeals@teachlink.io within 30 days. Appeals will be reviewed by a different set of maintainers than those who issued the original decision.

## Recognition for Positive Behavior

We also want to recognize and appreciate positive contributions to our community:

- **Community Champions**: Members who consistently help others and foster a welcoming environment
- **Mentorship Recognition**: Contributors who help onboard and guide new community members
- **Constructive Feedback Award**: For those who provide especially helpful and kind code reviews
