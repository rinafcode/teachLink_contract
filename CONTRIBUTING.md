## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create an issue first** for significant changes
2. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
3. **Follow naming conventions**: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`
4. **Keep PRs focused** - one logical change per PR

### PR Requirements

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- [ ] Lints pass (`cargo fmt && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventions
- [ ] PR description explains changes clearly

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat(contract): add learning reward distribution

Implements the reward distribution mechanism for completed lessons.
Tokens are distributed proportionally based on participation score.

Closes #42
```

### Review Process

1. **Automated checks** run first (CI/CD)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Security review** for sensitive changes
4. **Final approval** and merge
